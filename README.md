## Welcome to Aqua's Repository!

> Aquacious is fully open source to let people examine it and take some parts of it to use in their own projects!

We want to contribute to the stuff already out there so new people can learn!

## Installation and Setup
Unfortunately, the majority of Aqua's code is very static when it comes to things like posting updates in our [Support Server's](https://discord.gg/TRc3vENjCW) channels. Hence it is rather hard for new developers to get going. If you know enough JavaScript to be able to remove these functions, go ahead and do it! For anyone else, you may take parts of Aqua's code for your own projects if you need help with a command or something. 

Plans are being made to be more dynamic. Please stand by.
